00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,300
Anthropic just dropped its newest AI model called Clod 3.5 Sonnet, but it's not
quite

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,720
giving Shakespeare yet.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,000
Anthropic is a rival of OpenAI, the company that makes ChatGPT.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,520
That's some steep competition, and the pressure to keep pushing new updates is
strong.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,960
The Sonnet model can analyze text and images, as well as generate text, and its
ability

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,140
to analyze charts and graphs has gotten significantly better with this update.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,340
But the progress is only incremental, which makes sense, because this technology
is really

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,340
complicated and takes a long time to develop responsibly.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,400
Try telling that to your investors, though.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,900
TechCrunch reporter Kyle Wiggers said that while Sonnet looks really good on
paper, the

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,220
benchmarks that companies use to measure progress in AI sometimes aren't that
meaningful.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,700
These models are often tested on esoteric edge cases, like the kinds of
questions you'd

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,220
find in a PhD-level math class.

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:57,560
But most people are using these chatbots for much simpler tasks, like writing
cover letters.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,320
There's value in an AI being able to do that.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,900
There's value in being able to explain post-doc chemistry research, but maybe
not

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,720
every AI needs to be good at everything.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,600
If you're a historical researcher, for example, maybe you don't need an AI
trained on medical

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,680
information.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,040
As for what else is new with Sonnet, Anthropic is working on Artifacts, which is
a workspace

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,200
where users can edit and add to content that they've already generated with
Claude.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,880
The company wants to build this out to help teams collaborate, which points
toward Anthropic's

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,820
interest in attracting enterprise-level clients.

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,320
So far, that's an area where OpenAI has a lot of potential.

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:36,980
An executive at OpenAI disclosed last month that 93% of Fortune 500 companies
have enterprise-level

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,500
subscriptions to ChatGPT, but we don't know how much those companies are
actually using

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,120
it on a day-to-day basis.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,520
The release of the Sonnet model could be a sign that generative AI is entering
its iterative

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,200
era and growth is slowing down or becoming more predictable.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,020
AI might seem cutting edge, but it's repeating the same problems that we see
across the tech

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,800
industry.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,760
Investors want to see profits faster than ever.

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:58,880
They want to see more money coming in.

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:58,980
They want to see more money coming in.

35
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,080
They want to see more money coming in.

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,180
They want to see more money coming in.

37
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,260
They want to see more money coming in.

38
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,300
They want to see more money coming in.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
They want to see more money coming in.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
They want to see more money coming in.

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
They want to see more money coming in.

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
They want to see more money coming in.

43
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
They want to see more money coming in.

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
They're more interested in the future than the technology can actually keep up.

45
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,340
Seed-level venture funding for generative AI startups declined in the new year
and that

46
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,840
could be because this expensive technology isn't yielding the returns that
investors

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,360
want yet.
