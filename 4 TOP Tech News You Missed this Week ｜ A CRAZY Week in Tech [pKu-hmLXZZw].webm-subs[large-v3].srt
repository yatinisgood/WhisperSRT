00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
We are coming to you with a new episode of tech news that happened this past
week.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,980
Let me tell you, this past week was one that you really had to hold on for.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,140
It was kind of, scratch kind of, it was wild.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,660
Elon Musk, of course, was in a lot of headlines from open sourcing his upcoming
AI,

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,340
which we'll get into, to suing OpenAI.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,000
I mean, him alone, we can make a video on, but we're not going to.

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,060
We will cover that though.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,540
There are so many other things that you need to be aware of that happened in
tech

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,980
this past week around AI, coding, tech, and more.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,400
All right, let's get into it.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,420
What do the young kids say?

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,440
Let's get into spilling the tea.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,120
Oh, that's so cheesy.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,000
You get what I mean though.

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,300
Let's start off with, as I mentioned, Elon Musk.

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,120
And this week, actually today, as I am filming this,

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,680
he recently announced that his chatbot, Grok, is going to be open source.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,840
Now this is different because a lot of the other chatbots we have seen,

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,780
such as Gemini, let's go into, is not open source.

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,940
So the fact that this is going to be open source,

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,640
for the public to gain access to, is, well, huge.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,640
But let me explain why.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,120
By open sourcing his chatbot, here's what I would really do for people.

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,640
One, it would be to see what is going on behind the scenes.

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,380
What exactly is this code made up of?

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,440
What is this large language model made up of?

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,600
It will really promote transparency, open web, all this around AI,

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,740
which we have yet to see.

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,000
This could go in two ways.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,220
One, being very positive.

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,840
People have access to this information, build upon it,

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,620
and have a better understanding.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,100
This could be a great way to build these chatbots,

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,100
which in turn, better educated, makes informed decisions.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
On the other side though, it could do a bit of the opposite,

36
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,500
whereas, yes, we have this information, we know how they work.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,500
What could we do now with this information being open source?

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,800
Now I think this side, there's less to fear about.

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,000
I mean, if it's open source, I am sure they have their bases covered

40
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,800
that what they are sharing in the open source community is fine to be sharing.

41
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,860
But it does bring up this major question, which is,

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,860
should chatbots like Grok, like Gemini, like ChatGPT,

43
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,660
be open source?

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,960
What do you think about this?

45
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,960
Leave in the comments.

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,260
All right, keeping up with Elon Musk, this is our last one, I promise.

47
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,260
So if you love him, great.

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,060
If you hate him, still good to be informed.

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,860
Which is this week, he sued OpenAI.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,460
I mean, yes, he is the master of headline generators,

51
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,160
but it's really important to understand why he did this.

52
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,960
And when you realize why he did this,

53
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,460
it kind of makes you question everything about OpenAI,

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
at least to certain degrees.

55
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,060
He sued OpenAI because they did not, according to him or apparently,

56
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,760
what he is saying,

57
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,560
is they did not keep up with their promise or mission

58
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,760
to remain nonprofit and open source.

59
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,060
So when you really start to think about why he did this,

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,860
I don't think he really thinks in his heart of hearts

61
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,860
that anything will come from suing them.

62
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,460
But I do believe he is very aware that the media would gain onto this.

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,660
And then in turn, us as consumers and individuals would take a look at,

64
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,460
oh, wait, yeah, OpenAI really isn't that open source.

65
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,760
It isn't really not for profit, which is really interesting to look at.

66
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,460
Now, another thing

67
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,560
that's really important to note here is Elon Musk is coming for OpenAI.

68
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,160
I think this is really the tip of it.

69
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,760
The chatbot wars will continue,

70
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,060
especially now as he releases Grok compared to now chat with GPT,

71
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,260
compared to Gemini and others.

72
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,460
Okay, time for something different.

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,160
Let's switch gears here.

74
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,860
And I thought this was kind of, well, interesting to say the least,

75
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,360
which is Google employee is charged with stealing AI trade secrets.

76
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,360
Yes, you heard that right.

77
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,560
That's a really bold move, I have to say, on this employee's part.

78
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,260
Charged with stealing AI trade secrets.

79
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,160
All right, so what really happened here?

80
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,760
So this is a Google employee.

81
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,660
They were charged on Tuesday with stealing AI trade secrets from Google,

82
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,860
working with two Chinese-based companies in the AI industry.

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,460
So this individual, a 38-year-old who lives in California,

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,060
is accused of copying more than 500 files with confidential information from
Google

85
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,160
into his own personal account.

86
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,260
This is a bold move.

87
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,060
I mean, this started, they say, back in 2022.

88
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,460
So this has been going on for a while.

89
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,860
And this isn't just like your typical case.

90
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,160
I feel like there might be a movie made out of this, because here's why.

91
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,060
Actually, the FBI were involved.

92
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,960
This is the level that this was getting to.

93
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,960
So Google goes on to say they have strict safeguards to prevent the theft

94
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,960
and are confidential commercial information and trade secrets.

95
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,460
Of course.

96
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,260
So here is this individual, 38 years old, working from home,

97
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,060
dealing with Google's trade secrets, putting them into his own computer.

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,060
Really curious, though, what was he doing with that information?

99
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,260
What was the end goal here?

100
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,260
That we don't know, but I do believe it will come out soon.

101
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,260
That's just something really interesting on the side.

102
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,260
I mean, listen, if you lack confidence, look at this individual.

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,460
Don't do what he's doing.

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,060
But the amount of confidence that would take to do.

105
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,460
All right, let's move into something not AI related, which is security,
cybersecurity.

106
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,460
This is pretty interesting.

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,660
Russian hackers stole Microsoft's source code, and they're saying the attack
isn't over.

108
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,560
This is wild.

109
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,360
Listen to this.

110
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,460
Okay, so back in January this year, so what, two months ago, there was this big
attack.

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,860
And we, I think a lot of us were familiar with this.

112
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,060
Microsoft had an attack.

113
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,860
From some Russian hackers, and it kind of went quiet after that.

114
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,460
We never really heard what happened to it or where it went.

115
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,860
Now, what is coming to light is they actually were able to gain access to some
source code.

116
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,860
And this is where it affects you, potentially.

117
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,060
They also gained access to some customer secrets.

118
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,860
But here's the thing.

119
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,160
The reality is it's interesting when these hacks happen, whether it be through
with Microsoft

120
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,960
or other major tech companies, they often are so quiet about it initially.

121
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,760
Which I get why, but as a consumer, it's one of those things that then later

122
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,160
comes out in the news, or we see an article, and we're kind of not thinking
about it,

123
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,460
that, oh, by the way, your data was impacted, or potentially impacted anyways.

124
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,560
And it can bring kind of an almost icky feeling, where if it was right when it
happened,

125
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,060
transparent, this is going on, I think the public would react better.

126
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,060
So here is what was shared with Hacker News.

127
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,560
Microsoft's breach by Midnight Blizzard, the hacker group, is a strategic blow.

128
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,660
Midnight Blizzard isn't some small-time criminal gang.

129
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,460
They are highly professional, Russian-backed outfit that fully understands

130
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,260
the value of the data they've exposed, and how to best use it to inflict harm.

131
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,560
So this is really interesting.

132
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,160
This is far from over, but it's something to be very aware of.

133
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,060
And as you are keeping up to date with tech news, keeping that hack in mind,

134
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
just to see where it ends up going.

135
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,960
All right, those are some of the biggest things to happen in tech this past
week.

136
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,260
It was, I mean, big.

137
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,160
I got to say, Elon Musk does take the cake, the win, whatever you want to call
it,

138
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,360
for really keeping up in the media and news.

139
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,660
There was some wild things.

140
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,660
But on that note, I'm curious to get your take.

141
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,660
How closely are you following this?

142
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,960
How are you following these different kind of tech news updates from Elon Musk

143
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,460
to security to hacking?

144
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,860
Where are you at with all this?

145
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,660
Do you enjoy being up to date with it in a very quick, concise video like this?

146
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,660
Leave in the comments, and I will always keep you up to date with the latest
tech news,

147
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,160
updates, you know, all that good stuff.

148
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,260

Bye-bye.

153
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,860
Bye-bye.

154
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,860
Bye-bye.

155
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,860
Bye-bye.
