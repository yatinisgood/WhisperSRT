1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Is prompt engineering really going to take over software engineering?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,720
Well, for one thing, the president and co-founder of NVIDIA says this is going
to happen.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,960
Okay, let me explain. Jensen Huang, who is the president and co-founder of
NVIDIA,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,480
recently went on to the World Government Summit in Dubai and here's what he
said.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,320
He said that his statement that he was about to share is what most tech
influential people

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,640
have said over the last 10 or 15 years, which is that everyone, especially kids,

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,600
should learn how to code. So here's what he said though. He goes on to say,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,680
it is our job to create computing technology that nobody has to program

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,200
and that the programming language is human. Then he goes on to say,

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,360
everyone in the world is now a programmer. This is the miracle of AI.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,560
All right, before we dive into this topic further and really break down,

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,320
is software engineering getting replaced by prompt engineering? Make sure to hit

and leave in the

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,640

let's get into it.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,040
This is a really bold statement to make. And I think a lot of people,

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,040
if you are someone who is learning to code or just getting into tech, it will
feel very

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,520
discouraging because of this statement. I mean, I know for myself, when I was
learning how to code,

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,840
I was doing so during the boom of coding, if you will, meaning it was just
endless opportunities

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
and possibilities with this skill. And it was one of the hardest things I had to
learn,

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,440
but it was so rewarding. Now to see that this skill is something that might not
be learned or

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,160
as valuable, or people don't tout as people don't look up as this really great
skill.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,480
It really brings a lot of different emotions my way. Now I'm going to keep my
emotions out of

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,640
this video and really dive into the facts. So if you are someone who is learning
how to code,

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,040
getting into tech, or maybe you are an engineer, this video is for you. Now
let's start off with

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,000
the obvious. Jensen is not the first individual, especially of a high caliber to
be sharing these

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
statements. But for some reason, this time it felt different. I've heard a lot
of these statements

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,760
of how AI is going to take over programming, and I never really paid much
attention to it.

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,400
But this statement from him, I think it's because it feels so different because
we are at a time

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,120
where we can see that this could become a reality. Now here's the thing. I don't
want this video to

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,760
dissuade anyone or discourage anyone from learning to code. There is going to be
some really great

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,640
opportunities for you still, if you are in that boat. But what I think is a
bigger question here,

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,160
and what we really should look at rather than should you learn how to code
anymore,

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,040
or should you not learn how to code anymore, is what this

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,840
bigger picture here. Let's take a step back. I was going to take a step back
literally,

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,480
but the chair is in the way. And really say, see, what exactly does this mean?
Well, for one thing,

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,760
it means we are coming into a period of time that's never been done in history
before where

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,880
technology is advancing quicker than we can keep up with it. We are not able to
keep up on a daily

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,600
basis with the tech advancements anymore as humans. So yes, that can sound a
little bit scary

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,800
on one hand, but on the other hand, what it really is showing is you need to not
be comfortable in

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,520
your role, in your current skill sets, but being open to continue to evolve.

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,760
All right, Tiff, can you just cut to the chase? Is prompt engineering going to
replace software

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,000
engineers? No, it's not, at least not for the foreseeable future, but things are
going to change

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,440
drastically. And I mean, we already see this with how much now we are using AI
in our daily lives

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,400
when coding. Think of tools like Copilot or different, even ChatGPT when you are
coding,

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,520
you are now able to go into these artificial intelligent chatbots and ask for
help, get

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,420
suggestions at a quicker rate than you would have if you were a software
engineer. So, if you are

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,480
a software engineer, you are going to be able to do this much faster than ever
before.

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,360
Let's start though by breaking down what exactly is a prompt engineer. At its
core,

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,320
prompt engineering focuses on creating and designing prompts that are given to
AI models.

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,760
I mean, we always talk about ChatGPT to really instruct them to have the desired
outputs. So,

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,680
why is this role important? I think at first it was really laughed at as, oh,
this role is going

52
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,680
to come and go, but the more we grow with AI, the more we can realize that this
role is here to stay

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,880
and becoming more and more important. What sets prompt engineers apart? Well,

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,080
a lot of prompt engineers have a very strong background in machine learning or
artificial

55
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,160
intelligence. They are aware of how these models operate, how it will affect
them,

56
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,800
what they input into these models based on what they output and get, and they're
very

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,880
knowledgeable in that area. Now, that's not saying you have to have knowledge
around machine learning

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,280
or AI to become a prompt engineer, but at some level you do need to start diving
into it.

59
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,200
The other thing about prompt engineers is depending on what company they are
working for,

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,280
they usually are specialists within that industry. So, for example, prompt
engineering is something

61
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,920
that is widely used within the health industry. And if you are a prompt engineer
working in health

62
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,280
and trying to diagnose someone or have some understanding as to what ailments
they have,

63
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,080
you need to also have an understanding as to the health side of this industry.
You can't just be

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
this technical person. Okay, so here is the role of a prompt engineer broken
down pretty simply

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,280
for you. So, one, you have to design effective prompts. Two, refine and
optimize, so continuously

66
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,000
test and refine your prompts to ensure you're getting the best output. Number
three is customize

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,440
your prompts to fit particular projects or industries. This is kind of what we
spoke to

68
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,560
a little bit earlier, that you need to be, to some degree, an expert in that
field. And number four

69
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,920
is monitor outputs. So, ensure that the outputs are what is expected, that the
AI model isn't

70
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,800
hallucinating, and there isn't anything else weird going on there. All right, so
let's take a look at

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,600
how artificial intelligence has already impacted software engineering. Well, for
one thing, we

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,480
mentioned earlier, now we have code assistants. So, we have things such as
Copilot, who will now

73
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,120
write out tire intelligence. So, we have things such as Copilot, who will now
write out tire

74
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,640
intelligence. So, we have things such as Copilot, who will now write out entire
functions, entire

75
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,080
files for you or with you. The next is debugging and code review. Now, we have
tools that can help

76
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,240
you debug and also review your code, which is super helpful if you are someone
who is working

77
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,360
on a team. Next up, we have tools to automate documentation. I mean,
documentation is probably

78
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,680
one of the worst parts of software engineering, in my opinion, anyways. Who
wants to deal with

79
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,640
documentation? But having AI to help write documentation for you based on your
code

80
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,160
is a game changer. One of the tools I actually used,

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,160
quite a while ago and love, not sponsored, just shouting them out, is Swim. So,
Swim will actually

82
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,440
help generate documentation based on your files in your GitHub, which is, it's
really cool.

83
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,320
Anyway, so that's already exists too. Next is ideation and problem solving. So,

84
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,800
providing new approaches or algorithms for solving complex problems. I mean,

85
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,360
what is left for programmers? We just went through everything that AI can do.
The reality is,

86
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,960
even if prompt engineering takes over software engineering, which, let's do a
side note here,

87
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,320
doesn't mean software engineering doesn't exist. We're not having that
conversation. Of course,

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,240
it's going to exist. Say prompt engineering does grow and become more in demand
than a role like

89
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,360
software engineers. The reality is, A, if you are a software engineer growing
into a prompt

90
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,160
engineering role, or even staying in your software engineering role, it will
just start looking

91
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,720
different over time. We are in the weeds with this. We're not going to see this
happen directly

92
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,720
overnight. Although it does feel like it's happening very quickly. It's more so
being able

93
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,640
to use these AI tools, implement AI tools, and use them to solve complex
problems. So,

94
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,480
implement it into your workflow, and you are going to be fine. Going back to
what the president

95
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,200
and co-founder of Nvidia said, he also goes on to say that it's important for
people to learn

96
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,600
how to use generative AI. So, it will be vital that we upskill everyone. And the
upskilling

97
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,560
process, I will be delightful and surprising. He's very optimistic. But to his
point,

98
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,880
it is going to be more and more vital that we continue to get more comfortable
with these

99
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360
generative AI tools versus saying, we are too good for them. We're not going to
use them.

100
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,480
The reality is they are here and they're here to stay. Okay. So,

101
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,040
to the chase, is prompt engineering going to overtake software engineering?
There will always

102
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,440
be a place for software engineers and there will always be a place for prompt
engineers. But I do

103
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,920
see that these two roles will merge closer and closer together. I mean, prompt
engineering will

104
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,000
merge with many different roles. And I do believe software engineering is one of
them. All right.

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm curious to hear, do you agree with my thoughts? Do you disagree? I try and
stay

106
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,920
pretty neutral on this because the reality is we don't know what we don't know.
And the

107
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,400
most important takeaway is being open to continuous learning and not...

108
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,080
freaking out like that meme where the dog is standing with a cup and
everything's blowing

109
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,840
up around him. All right. Thank you all for watching and make sure to hit that
