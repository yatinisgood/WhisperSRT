00:00.000 --> 00:04.120
We are coming to you with a new episode of tech news that happened this past
week.

00:04.240 --> 00:07.980
Let me tell you, this past week was one that you really had to hold on for.

00:08.060 --> 00:11.140
It was kind of, scratch kind of, it was wild.

00:11.320 --> 00:15.660
Elon Musk, of course, was in a lot of headlines from open sourcing his upcoming
AI,

00:15.820 --> 00:18.340
which we'll get into, to suing OpenAI.

00:18.840 --> 00:22.000
I mean, him alone, we can make a video on, but we're not going to.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.060
We will cover that though.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.540
There are so many other things that you need to be aware of that happened in
tech

00:26.540 --> 00:29.980
this past week around AI, coding, tech, and more.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.400
All right, let's get into it.

00:32.480 --> 00:33.420
What do the young kids say?

00:33.540 --> 00:35.440
Let's get into spilling the tea.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.120
Oh, that's so cheesy.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.000
You get what I mean though.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.300
Let's start off with, as I mentioned, Elon Musk.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.120
And this week, actually today, as I am filming this,

00:47.340 --> 00:51.680
he recently announced that his chatbot, Grok, is going to be open source.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.840
Now this is different because a lot of the other chatbots we have seen,

00:54.840 --> 00:57.780
such as Gemini, let's go into, is not open source.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.940
So the fact that this is going to be open source,

01:00.060 --> 01:03.640
for the public to gain access to, is, well, huge.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.640
But let me explain why.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.120
By open sourcing his chatbot, here's what I would really do for people.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.640
One, it would be to see what is going on behind the scenes.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.380
What exactly is this code made up of?

01:13.460 --> 01:16.440
What is this large language model made up of?

01:16.640 --> 01:21.600
It will really promote transparency, open web, all this around AI,

01:21.680 --> 01:22.740
which we have yet to see.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.000
This could go in two ways.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.220
One, being very positive.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.840
People have access to this information, build upon it,

01:27.920 --> 01:29.620
and have a better understanding.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.100
This could be a great way to build these chatbots,

01:32.200 --> 01:35.100
which in turn, better educated, makes informed decisions.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.800
On the other side though, it could do a bit of the opposite,

01:37.900 --> 01:40.500
whereas, yes, we have this information, we know how they work.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.500
What could we do now with this information being open source?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.800
Now I think this side, there's less to fear about.

01:45.900 --> 01:49.000
I mean, if it's open source, I am sure they have their bases covered

01:49.100 --> 01:52.800
that what they are sharing in the open source community is fine to be sharing.

01:52.900 --> 01:55.860
But it does bring up this major question, which is,

01:55.960 --> 01:59.860
should chatbots like Grok, like Gemini, like ChatGPT,

01:59.860 --> 02:00.660
be open source?

02:00.760 --> 02:01.960
What do you think about this?

02:02.060 --> 02:02.960
Leave in the comments.

02:03.060 --> 02:06.260
All right, keeping up with Elon Musk, this is our last one, I promise.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.260
So if you love him, great.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.060
If you hate him, still good to be informed.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.860
Which is this week, he sued OpenAI.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.460
I mean, yes, he is the master of headline generators,

02:15.560 --> 02:18.160
but it's really important to understand why he did this.

02:18.260 --> 02:19.960
And when you realize why he did this,

02:20.060 --> 02:23.460
it kind of makes you question everything about OpenAI,

02:23.560 --> 02:24.560
at least to certain degrees.

02:24.660 --> 02:29.060
He sued OpenAI because they did not, according to him or apparently,

02:29.140 --> 02:29.760
what he is saying,

02:29.860 --> 02:32.560
is they did not keep up with their promise or mission

02:32.660 --> 02:35.760
to remain nonprofit and open source.

02:35.860 --> 02:39.060
So when you really start to think about why he did this,

02:39.160 --> 02:41.860
I don't think he really thinks in his heart of hearts

02:41.960 --> 02:43.860
that anything will come from suing them.

02:43.960 --> 02:48.460
But I do believe he is very aware that the media would gain onto this.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.660
And then in turn, us as consumers and individuals would take a look at,

02:52.760 --> 02:55.460
oh, wait, yeah, OpenAI really isn't that open source.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.760
It isn't really not for profit, which is really interesting to look at.

02:58.860 --> 02:59.460
Now, another thing

02:59.460 --> 03:03.560
that's really important to note here is Elon Musk is coming for OpenAI.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.160
I think this is really the tip of it.

03:05.260 --> 03:06.760
The chatbot wars will continue,

03:06.860 --> 03:11.060
especially now as he releases Grok compared to now chat with GPT,

03:11.160 --> 03:13.260
compared to Gemini and others.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.460
Okay, time for something different.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.160
Let's switch gears here.

03:15.260 --> 03:18.860
And I thought this was kind of, well, interesting to say the least,

03:18.960 --> 03:23.360
which is Google employee is charged with stealing AI trade secrets.

03:23.460 --> 03:24.360
Yes, you heard that right.

03:24.460 --> 03:27.560
That's a really bold move, I have to say, on this employee's part.

03:27.660 --> 03:29.260
Charged with stealing AI trade secrets.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.160
All right, so what really happened here?

03:31.260 --> 03:32.760
So this is a Google employee.

03:32.860 --> 03:36.660
They were charged on Tuesday with stealing AI trade secrets from Google,

03:36.760 --> 03:39.860
working with two Chinese-based companies in the AI industry.

03:39.960 --> 03:43.460
So this individual, a 38-year-old who lives in California,

03:43.560 --> 03:49.060
is accused of copying more than 500 files with confidential information from
Google

03:49.160 --> 03:51.160
into his own personal account.

03:51.260 --> 03:53.260
This is a bold move.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.060
I mean, this started, they say, back in 2022.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.460
So this has been going on for a while.

03:58.460 --> 04:00.860
And this isn't just like your typical case.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.160
I feel like there might be a movie made out of this, because here's why.

04:03.260 --> 04:05.060
Actually, the FBI were involved.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.960
This is the level that this was getting to.

04:07.060 --> 04:10.960
So Google goes on to say they have strict safeguards to prevent the theft

04:11.060 --> 04:13.960
and are confidential commercial information and trade secrets.

04:14.060 --> 04:14.460
Of course.

04:14.560 --> 04:18.260
So here is this individual, 38 years old, working from home,

04:18.360 --> 04:22.060
dealing with Google's trade secrets, putting them into his own computer.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.060
Really curious, though, what was he doing with that information?

04:25.160 --> 04:26.260
What was the end goal here?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.260
That we don't know, but I do believe it will come out soon.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.260
That's just something really interesting on the side.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.260
I mean, listen, if you lack confidence, look at this individual.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.460
Don't do what he's doing.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.060
But the amount of confidence that would take to do.

04:37.160 --> 04:41.460
All right, let's move into something not AI related, which is security,
cybersecurity.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.460
This is pretty interesting.

04:42.560 --> 04:47.660
Russian hackers stole Microsoft's source code, and they're saying the attack
isn't over.

04:47.760 --> 04:48.560
This is wild.

04:48.660 --> 04:49.360
Listen to this.

04:49.460 --> 04:54.460
Okay, so back in January this year, so what, two months ago, there was this big
attack.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.860
And we, I think a lot of us were familiar with this.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.060
Microsoft had an attack.

04:58.060 --> 05:00.860
From some Russian hackers, and it kind of went quiet after that.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.460
We never really heard what happened to it or where it went.

05:03.560 --> 05:07.860
Now, what is coming to light is they actually were able to gain access to some
source code.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.860
And this is where it affects you, potentially.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.060
They also gained access to some customer secrets.

05:14.160 --> 05:14.860
But here's the thing.

05:14.960 --> 05:19.160
The reality is it's interesting when these hacks happen, whether it be through
with Microsoft

05:19.260 --> 05:23.960
or other major tech companies, they often are so quiet about it initially.

05:24.060 --> 05:27.760
Which I get why, but as a consumer, it's one of those things that then later

05:27.760 --> 05:31.160
comes out in the news, or we see an article, and we're kind of not thinking
about it,

05:31.260 --> 05:35.460
that, oh, by the way, your data was impacted, or potentially impacted anyways.

05:35.560 --> 05:39.560
And it can bring kind of an almost icky feeling, where if it was right when it
happened,

05:39.660 --> 05:43.060
transparent, this is going on, I think the public would react better.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.060
So here is what was shared with Hacker News.

05:45.160 --> 05:49.560
Microsoft's breach by Midnight Blizzard, the hacker group, is a strategic blow.

05:49.660 --> 05:52.660
Midnight Blizzard isn't some small-time criminal gang.

05:52.760 --> 05:57.460
They are highly professional, Russian-backed outfit that fully understands

05:57.760 --> 06:02.260
the value of the data they've exposed, and how to best use it to inflict harm.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.560
So this is really interesting.

06:03.660 --> 06:06.160
This is far from over, but it's something to be very aware of.

06:06.260 --> 06:10.060
And as you are keeping up to date with tech news, keeping that hack in mind,

06:10.160 --> 06:11.760
just to see where it ends up going.

06:11.860 --> 06:14.960
All right, those are some of the biggest things to happen in tech this past
week.

06:15.060 --> 06:16.260
It was, I mean, big.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.160
I got to say, Elon Musk does take the cake, the win, whatever you want to call
it,

06:20.260 --> 06:23.360
for really keeping up in the media and news.

06:23.460 --> 06:24.660
There was some wild things.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.660
But on that note, I'm curious to get your take.

06:26.760 --> 06:27.660
How closely are you following this?

06:27.760 --> 06:30.960
How are you following these different kind of tech news updates from Elon Musk

06:31.060 --> 06:33.460
to security to hacking?

06:33.560 --> 06:34.860
Where are you at with all this?

06:34.960 --> 06:38.660
Do you enjoy being up to date with it in a very quick, concise video like this?

06:38.760 --> 06:42.660
Leave in the comments, and I will always keep you up to date with the latest
tech news,

06:42.760 --> 06:45.160
updates, you know, all that good stuff.

06:45.260 --> 06:47.260
So you don't have to read and spend all your time doing so.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.760
Oh, and hit that subscribe button.

06:48.860 --> 06:49.960
All right, see you all soon.

06:57.760 --> 06:58.760
Bye-bye.

06:58.860 --> 06:59.860
Bye-bye.

06:59.960 --> 07:00.860
Bye-bye.

07:00.960 --> 07:01.860
Bye-bye.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.860
Bye-bye.
