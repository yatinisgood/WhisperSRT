 Anthropic just dropped its newest AI model called Clod 3.5 Sonnet, but it's not quite giving Shakespeare yet. Anthropic is a rival of OpenAI, the company that makes ChatGPT. That's some steep competition, and the pressure to keep pushing new updates is strong. The Sonnet model can analyze text and images, as well as generate text, and its ability to analyze charts and graphs has gotten significantly better with this update. But the progress is only incremental, which makes sense, because this technology is really complicated and takes a long time to develop responsibly. Try telling that to your investors, though. TechCrunch reporter Kyle Wiggers said that while Sonnet looks really good on paper, the benchmarks that companies use to measure progress in AI sometimes aren't that meaningful. These models are often tested on esoteric edge cases, like the kinds of questions you'd find in a PhD-level math class. But most people are using these chatbots for much simpler tasks, like writing cover letters. There's value in an AI being able to do that. There's value in being able to explain post-doc chemistry research, but maybe not every AI needs to be good at everything. If you're a historical researcher, for example, maybe you don't need an AI trained on medical information. As for what else is new with Sonnet, Anthropic is working on Artifacts, which is a workspace where users can edit and add to content that they've already generated with Claude. The company wants to build this out to help teams collaborate, which points toward Anthropic's interest in attracting enterprise-level clients. So far, that's an area where OpenAI has a lot of potential. An executive at OpenAI disclosed last month that 93% of Fortune 500 companies have enterprise-level subscriptions to ChatGPT, but we don't know how much those companies are actually using it on a day-to-day basis. The release of the Sonnet model could be a sign that generative AI is entering its iterative era and growth is slowing down or becoming more predictable. AI might seem cutting edge, but it's repeating the same problems that we see across the tech industry. Investors want to see profits faster than ever. They want to see more money coming in. They want to see more money coming in. They want to see more money coming in. They want to see more money coming in. They want to see more money coming in. They want to see more money coming in. They want to see more money coming in. They want to see more money coming in. They want to see more money coming in. They want to see more money coming in. They want to see more money coming in. They're more interested in the future than the technology can actually keep up. Seed-level venture funding for generative AI startups declined in the new year and that could be because this expensive technology isn't yielding the returns that investors want yet.
