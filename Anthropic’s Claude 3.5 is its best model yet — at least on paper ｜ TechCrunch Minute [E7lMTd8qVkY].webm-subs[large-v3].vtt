00:00.480 --> 00:06.300
Anthropic just dropped its newest AI model called Clod 3.5 Sonnet, but it's not
quite

00:06.300 --> 00:07.720
giving Shakespeare yet.

00:07.720 --> 00:12.000
Anthropic is a rival of OpenAI, the company that makes ChatGPT.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.520
That's some steep competition, and the pressure to keep pushing new updates is
strong.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.960
The Sonnet model can analyze text and images, as well as generate text, and its
ability

00:20.960 --> 00:25.140
to analyze charts and graphs has gotten significantly better with this update.

00:25.140 --> 00:29.340
But the progress is only incremental, which makes sense, because this technology
is really

00:29.340 --> 00:33.340
complicated and takes a long time to develop responsibly.

00:33.340 --> 00:35.400
Try telling that to your investors, though.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.900
TechCrunch reporter Kyle Wiggers said that while Sonnet looks really good on
paper, the

00:39.900 --> 00:45.220
benchmarks that companies use to measure progress in AI sometimes aren't that
meaningful.

00:45.220 --> 00:49.700
These models are often tested on esoteric edge cases, like the kinds of
questions you'd

00:49.700 --> 00:52.220
find in a PhD-level math class.

00:52.220 --> 00:57.560
But most people are using these chatbots for much simpler tasks, like writing
cover letters.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.320
There's value in an AI being able to do that.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.900
There's value in being able to explain post-doc chemistry research, but maybe
not

01:02.900 --> 01:05.720
every AI needs to be good at everything.

01:05.720 --> 01:10.600
If you're a historical researcher, for example, maybe you don't need an AI
trained on medical

01:10.600 --> 01:11.680
information.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.040
As for what else is new with Sonnet, Anthropic is working on Artifacts, which is
a workspace

01:16.040 --> 01:20.200
where users can edit and add to content that they've already generated with
Claude.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.880
The company wants to build this out to help teams collaborate, which points
toward Anthropic's

01:24.880 --> 01:27.820
interest in attracting enterprise-level clients.

01:27.820 --> 01:29.320
So far, that's an area where OpenAI has a lot of potential.

01:29.320 --> 01:36.980
An executive at OpenAI disclosed last month that 93% of Fortune 500 companies
have enterprise-level

01:36.980 --> 01:41.500
subscriptions to ChatGPT, but we don't know how much those companies are
actually using

01:41.500 --> 01:43.120
it on a day-to-day basis.

01:43.120 --> 01:47.520
The release of the Sonnet model could be a sign that generative AI is entering
its iterative

01:47.520 --> 01:51.200
era and growth is slowing down or becoming more predictable.

01:51.200 --> 01:56.020
AI might seem cutting edge, but it's repeating the same problems that we see
across the tech

01:56.020 --> 01:57.800
industry.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.760
Investors want to see profits faster than ever.

01:58.760 --> 01:58.880
They want to see more money coming in.

01:58.880 --> 01:58.980
They want to see more money coming in.

01:58.980 --> 01:59.080
They want to see more money coming in.

01:59.080 --> 01:59.180
They want to see more money coming in.

01:59.180 --> 01:59.260
They want to see more money coming in.

01:59.260 --> 01:59.300
They want to see more money coming in.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.320
They want to see more money coming in.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.320
They want to see more money coming in.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.320
They want to see more money coming in.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.320
They want to see more money coming in.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.320
They want to see more money coming in.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.320
They're more interested in the future than the technology can actually keep up.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.340
Seed-level venture funding for generative AI startups declined in the new year
and that

02:06.340 --> 02:10.840
could be because this expensive technology isn't yielding the returns that
investors

02:10.840 --> 02:11.360
want yet.
