00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,240
Welcome to Netflix Creative Labs. In this episode, we'd like to take you back
into

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,040
the world of machine learning, where it continues to revolutionize our industry.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,180
My name is Kelly Griggs. My name is Anish Bhattakavi. Here at Netflix, the

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,400
utilization of machine learning has significantly changed the way we work.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,960
Algorithms are used in various fields, including mathematics, computer science,

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,020
and everyday problem-solving. This tool simplifies the process for building

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,100
machine learning models. The core idea is that anyone can train a machine

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,240
learning model. All you have to do is spend some time in our tool and label

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,740
some examples as positive or negative. Imagine having to sift through over 1

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,360
million movies with over 2 billion shots to organize and categorize. It's a

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,140
daunting task, but we have found a solution that can streamline the process.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,820
The ingredients or building blocks of our content understanding, simplified, is

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,980
a binary human in-the-loop approach to machine learning classification. Any

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,940
one can simply click positive or negative for the examples presented, thus

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,980
strengthening the algorithm's classification. Some users have called it

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,280
fun and addictive, which are not adjectives you usually hear about data

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,840
annotation. Our video annotator tool is an excellent example of how Netflix

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,060
leverages machine learning. We can train algorithms faster and have more time to

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,700
actually get creative. We want to show people their favorite moments when that

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,100
moment arrives.
