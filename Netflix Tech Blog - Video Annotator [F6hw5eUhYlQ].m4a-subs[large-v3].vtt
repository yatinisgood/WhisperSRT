Welcome to Netflix Creative Labs. In this episode, we'd like to take you back
into

00:05.240 --> 00:10.040
the world of machine learning, where it continues to revolutionize our industry.

00:10.040 --> 00:15.180
My name is Kelly Griggs. My name is Anish Bhattakavi. Here at Netflix, the

00:15.180 --> 00:18.400
utilization of machine learning has significantly changed the way we work.

00:18.400 --> 00:22.960
Algorithms are used in various fields, including mathematics, computer science,

00:22.960 --> 00:28.020
and everyday problem-solving. This tool simplifies the process for building

00:28.020 --> 00:32.100
machine learning models. The core idea is that anyone can train a machine

00:32.100 --> 00:36.240
learning model. All you have to do is spend some time in our tool and label

00:36.240 --> 00:40.740
some examples as positive or negative. Imagine having to sift through over 1

00:40.740 --> 00:45.360
million movies with over 2 billion shots to organize and categorize. It's a

00:45.360 --> 00:49.140
daunting task, but we have found a solution that can streamline the process.

00:49.140 --> 00:53.820
The ingredients or building blocks of our content understanding, simplified, is

00:53.820 --> 00:57.980
a binary human in-the-loop approach to machine learning classification. Any

00:57.980 --> 01:01.940
one can simply click positive or negative for the examples presented, thus

01:01.940 --> 01:05.980
strengthening the algorithm's classification. Some users have called it

01:05.980 --> 01:10.280
fun and addictive, which are not adjectives you usually hear about data

01:10.280 --> 01:15.840
annotation. Our video annotator tool is an excellent example of how Netflix

01:15.840 --> 01:20.060
leverages machine learning. We can train algorithms faster and have more time to

01:20.060 --> 01:23.700
actually get creative. We want to show people their favorite moments when that

01:23.700 --> 01:26.100
moment arrives.
