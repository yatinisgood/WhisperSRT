 Welcome to Netflix Creative Labs. In this episode, we'd like to take you back into the world of machine learning, where it continues to revolutionize our industry. My name is Kelly Griggs. My name is Anish Bhattakavi. Here at Netflix, the utilization of machine learning has significantly changed the way we work. Algorithms are used in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and everyday problem-solving. This tool simplifies the process for building machine learning models. The core idea is that anyone can train a machine learning model. All you have to do is spend some time in our tool and label some examples as positive or negative. Imagine having to sift through over 1 million movies with over 2 billion shots to organize and categorize. It's a daunting task, but we have found a solution that can streamline the process. The ingredients or building blocks of our content understanding, simplified, is a binary human in-the-loop approach to machine learning classification. Any one can simply click positive or negative for the examples presented, thus strengthening the algorithm's classification. Some users have called it fun and addictive, which are not adjectives you usually hear about data annotation. Our video annotator tool is an excellent example of how Netflix leverages machine learning. We can train algorithms faster and have more time to actually get creative. We want to show people their favorite moments when that moment arrives. Learn more at Netflix.com. Techblog.com, the future of creativity.
